# Georgia Tech CS 4476: Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the Georgia Tech CS 4476 Computer Vision course, taught by Professor James Hays. The course website can be found [here](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/).

## Projects Overview

The repository contains the following projects:

1. [Project 1: Image Filtering and Hybrid Images](./project1)
2. [Project 2: Local Feature Matching](./project2)
3. [Project 3: Camera Calibration and Fundamental Matrix Estimation](./project3)
4. [Project 4: Scene Recognition with Bag of Words](./project4)
5. [Project 5: Face Detection with a Sliding Window](./project5)

Each project folder includes its own README.md file with detailed information about the specific project, its objectives, and the techniques used.

## Course Description

CS 4476 covers the fundamentals of computer vision, including image formation, feature detection, segmentation, multiple-view geometry, and object and scene recognition. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through programming assignments and projects that provide practical experience with computer vision algorithms and techniques.
